## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

The iZooto Android SDK provides push notification service for mobile apps. This plugin makes it easy to implement push notifications on your Android app built on the Native framework.

For more information check out our  [website](https://www.izooto.com)  and  [documentation](https://help.izooto.com/docs/app-push-notifications-overview).

## ðŸŽ‰ Installation

We publish the SDK to `mavenCentral` as an `AAR` file. Just declare it as dependency in your `build.gradle` file.
```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig{
        manifestPlaceholders = [
                izooto_app_id : 'YOUR_iZOOTO_APP_ID_HERE'
        ]
    }
}
```
```groovy
    dependencies {
    implementation 'com.izooto:android-sdk:2.6.2'
    implementation("androidx.work:work-runtime:2.9.0")
    }
```

Alternatively, you can download and add the AAR file included in this repo in your Module libs directory and tell gradle to install it like this:

### ðŸ“– Dependencies

Add the Firebase Messaging library and Android Support Library v4 as dependencies to your Module `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
     dependencies {
         implementation 'com.izooto:android-sdk:2.6.2'
         implementation("androidx.work:work-runtime:2.9.0")
         implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:23.0.6"
     }
```

Also be sure to include the `google-services.json` classpath in your Project level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
    // Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.         
        
    buildscript {       
         repositories {      
             google()
             mavenCentral()
         }       
         dependencies {      
             classpath "com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0"
             classpath "com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3"
        
             // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong       
             // in the individual module build.gradle files      
         }       
    }
```

Add your FCM generated `google-services.json` file to your project and add the following to the end of your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

Once you've updated your module `build.gradle` file, make sure you have specified `mavenCentral()` and `google()` as a repositories in your project `build.gradle` and then sync your project in File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files.
